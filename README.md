# Torre - Technical Test -  Progress log


# Start
First of all I checked the endpoints sent, diggin on them and explore the different options.
The challenge has begun, so was a brainstorming time.

# Check opportunities:
The idea is to create something original and not conventional, the goal is to show skills and strengths. One of them is develop with C# on Unity (Create mobile videogames is one of my favorite hobbies) so this will be a razonable way to face the challenge.

# Let’s do it!:
I want to recreate (somehow) the torre user profile (or just show the user information) but in a different way, maybe like an interactive (touchable) screen, or maybe a game… (brainstorming wasn’t end). So the endpoint to work will be: - GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)

# Not a Video Game… but Augmented Reality can be:
There’s not enough time to build a video game on this Challenge (yikes!)... but what if build a mobile app with AR where the user can see their profile (or others profile) in an animated 3D UI? Seems like this is the way!

# Time is my enemy. Run!:
Unity 3D project with AR Foundation (iOS ARKit) created.
Github repository created. (https://github.com/RockerCat/GenomeAR)
Main Scene and initial classes created.

# Sketchs/Mockups:
I hand draw a couple of UI ideas:

# UI Design:
Polish the design elements:

# Development:
Main scene showing the hexagon 3D object with AR
Create the Communicator Class
Load and parse the endpoint using my username (alexsosa)
Create LoadImage Class (to load the profile picture) and assign it as a texture.
Create UI Elements and UIManager Class to manage it.
Show the user information on hexagons (Hexagon and HexagonsManager classes).
Create userName box (UI form that allows the user to change the username and refresh the information)
Animate hexagons and information

# Testing:
Test, Bug fixing and test again.

# Polish and Clean:
Cleaning assets/code and final details.

# And… that’s it, I like it!:
That was my journey (2 days of coding). Feels like a hackathon!
